##Inspiration and Objectives

My son loves it when we change the color of our LIFX bulbs with Alexa.  He jumps up and down and shouts out the next color he wants to see.  This is fine, except it doesn't give him the power to change the colors on his own.  As a toddler, he can't quite articulate "Alexa, turn the basement lights red."  This wouldn't be a problem if it didn't mean an adult unit is tied up relaying orders like the second in command of a submarine (apologies to any submariners, I don't know if you actually relay orders) so he can get his RGB fix.

While clearly articulating instructions to a voice assistant isn't his strong suit, my son can push buttons like no other and I knew a custom remote would be right up his alley.  A quick DuckDuckGo search later and I found that LIFX has a developer portal and an API available that would give me a way to bestow upon him the power over lighting he craved.  At the same time, I wouldn't be doing my parental duty if I didn't at least try to make this an educational experience as well.  I decided that this would be a good opportunity to start teaching him about primary colors and how mixing them create the secondary colors.

Finally, I wanted to actually finish this project (I have many projects just short of finished) and share it with the maker community.  

So, objectives for this build are as follows:

*	Fun and educational toy for my son.
*	Fun and educational build for myself.
*   Finish and publish the project.
